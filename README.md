This is a repository containing various functions and methods aimed to providing new ways to analyze DNA sequencing data. Methods along with their documentation detailing how to use them as well as examples can be found within the repo.

Future plans include uploading this library onto PyPi so it can be used easily with pip install.

Currently this code is being developed and maintained by the [Glass Lab](glasslab.ucsd.edu).
